                <p class="lead">Hello! My name is Michael Washington, and I am a sophomore Computer Science student at The University
                  of Texas at El Paso. I've been programming for just over a year now, and I have loved every minute of it.
                  I'm currently taking Data Structures and Algorithms, Automata, Calculus 2, and physics. This year, I've been trying to learn 
                  more about programming in general and about artificial intelligence. Besides working with computers,
                  I also love nature, working out, and playing video games.

              <h3>Personal Projects</h3>
              <p>In order to keep learning and pushing myself, I have worked on a few projects outside of school.
                These include a basic calculator, remakes of classic games such as "Snake," a tool 
                to log in to my college account automatically, and even this website. All of these projects are in my github repository,
                which can be accessed <a href="https://github.com/mclwshngtn/Projects.git">here</a>.
              </p>

            <div class = "resume">
              <h3>Resume</h3>
              <p>I've also included my personal resume, available for download <a href="./images/MichaelWashingtonResume.pdf" download = "MclWashingtonResume">here</a>, 
                which includes my previous experiences and relevant skills. I have worked as an intern at a local small business, where I helped build and maintain websites for clients,
                along with implementing a service using Google Analytics that provides information (such as how many people have visited the site) 
                to the client. I also helped design a real-time system that monitors support tickets for a client.
